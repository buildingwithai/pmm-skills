## Community Launch Tactics

### Product Hunt

**Why Product Hunt:** Still the #1 community launch platform. Can generate 500-2,500+ sign-ups in 24 hours if done right.

**When to launch:** Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday (avoid Monday/Friday). Launch at 12:01am PST.

**Pre-Launch (2-4 weeks before):**
- [ ] Build your Ship page (free pre-launch landing)
- [ ] Engage authentically (comment on other launches)
- [ ] Build relationships with hunters
- [ ] Recruit your "launch crew" (10-20 supporters)
- [ ] Prepare all assets (tagline, gallery images, description)

**Launch Day (Hour-by-Hour):**

**12:01am PST:** Go live
- Submit product
- Post first comment (tell your story, why you built this)
- Notify launch crew (Discord, Slack, email)

**6am-9am PST:** Morning push
- Share on Twitter/LinkedIn
- Email your list
- Respond to every comment within 15 minutes
- Keep engagement high (PH algorithm favors active discussions)

**9am-12pm PST:** Peak hours
- Monitor rankings (#1-5 is sweet spot)
- Engage deeply with commenters
- Share to relevant Slack/Discord communities
- Post updates as you hit milestones ("50 upvotes! 🎉")

**12pm-5pm PST:** Maintain momentum
- Continue fast responses
- Thank supporters publicly
- Address concerns authentically
- Share user testimonials as they come in

**5pm-11:59pm PST:** Close strong
- Final push to your audience
- Thank everyone who supported
- Tease follow-up (what's next)

**Post-Launch:**
- Export emails of hunters who upvoted (PH provides this)
- Follow up with personal thank yous
- Share results and learnings

**Pro tips:**
- Response speed matters more than upvote count
- Authenticity beats marketing speak
- Engage with other launches too (community spirit)
- Have your "why" story ready (not just "what")

### Reddit

**Why Reddit:** Authentic engagement with highly engaged communities. Can drive 100-500 signups if done right, but easy to get flagged as spam.

**Subreddit selection:**
- Research where your ICP hangs out (3-5 subreddits)
- Check rules (many prohibit self-promotion)
- Lurk for 2-4 weeks before posting
- Engage authentically first (comment, help others)

**Types of posts that work:**

**1. "I built this" posts (for maker communities):**
- r/SaaS
- r/EntrepreneurRideAlong
- r/IMadeThis
- r/InternetIsBeautiful
- r/SideProject

**Template:**
```
Title: "I spent 6 months building [problem solver] after [personal story]"

Body:
- Start with your "why" (personal story, frustration)
- Explain what you built (focus on problem solved, not features)
- Show, don't tell (screenshots, demo)
- Ask for feedback (genuinely want to improve)
- Optional: Special offer for community ("Redditors get 50% off")

End with: "Would love your honest feedback, especially [specific aspect]"
```

**2. "Ask Me Anything" (for expertise):**
- Share unique insight or data
- Offer to answer questions
- Link to product naturally in bio or as tool used

**3. Helpful comments:**
- Find posts asking for solutions to problem your product solves
- Provide helpful advice first
- Mention your product as one option (among others)
- Don't be salesy

**Red flags (will get downvoted/banned):**
- Pure promotion with no story/value
- Fake accounts commenting positively
- Deleting negative comments
- Being defensive about feedback

**Best practices:**
- Use your real account (post history matters)
- Respond to every comment
- Accept criticism gracefully
- Focus on community value, not conversions

---

### LinkedIn (2024 Strategies)

**Why LinkedIn:** Video content up 6x in 2024. Best B2B audience. Founder-led content performs well.

**Content types that work:**

**1. Founder story (personal account):**
- Video of you explaining why you built this
- Behind-the-scenes of launch process
- Vulnerable sharing of challenges
- 30-90 second videos (LinkedIn native video)

**Example:**
"We launched our product today. Here's what the last 90 days looked like... [show timeline, challenges, wins]"

**2. Customer success stories:**
- Short case study format
- Before/after comparison
- Specific metrics ("reduced time by 73%")
- Tag the customer (if they agree)

**3. Launch announcement:**
- Clear value proposition
- Visual (product screenshot or demo)
- Call-to-action (try it, request demo)
- Personal note from founder

**Timing:**
- Post between 8-10am or 12-1pm on Tuesday-Thursday
- Video content gets 6x more engagement than text-only
- Native video > linked video

**Employee advocacy:**
- Have team members share and comment
- 2x click-through rate vs company posts
- Provide them draft copy (make it easy)

**Paid LinkedIn:**
- Sponsored content to amplify founder posts
- Target by job title, company size, industry
- Retarget website visitors
- $10-25 CPM for B2B audiences
