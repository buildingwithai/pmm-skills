# Go-to-Market Strategy

**Purpose:** Choose the right GTM motion and channel strategy for your product launch.

**When to use:** During launch planning (Days 8-14 of 90-day roadmap) to determine how you'll acquire and activate customers.

**Output:** GTM strategy document with motion (PLG vs sales-led), channel priorities, and budget allocation.

---

## Overview

Your GTM strategy determines HOW customers discover, evaluate, purchase, and adopt your product. The two fundamental motions are Product-Led Growth (PLG) and Sales-Led Growth, with most companies using a hybrid approach.

**Key decision:** Which motion is primary? This affects everything from pricing to team structure to launch tactics.

---

## Product-Led Growth (PLG) vs Sales-Led

### Product-Led Growth (PLG)

**Definition:** Product itself drives acquisition, conversion, and expansion. Users can sign up, activate, and get value without talking to sales.

**Characteristics:**
- Self-serve sign-up and onboarding
- Free trial or freemium model
- Low/no touch sales
- Viral mechanics and referrals
- Time-to-value <15 minutes
- Bottom-up adoption (users → teams → enterprise)

**When PLG works:**
- Price point <$50K ACV
- Simple onboarding (<15 min to "Aha moment")
- Broad user base (horizontal product)
- Network effects or viral loops possible
- Low customer acquisition cost needed

**Examples:** Slack, Notion, Figma, Calendly, Loom, Canva

**2024 data:** PLG companies grow 50% YoY vs 21% for traditional sales-led (OpenView)

---

### Sales-Led Growth

**Definition:** Sales team drives acquisition through outbound prospecting, demos, and relationship building.

**Characteristics:**
- Complex enterprise sales cycles (3-12 months)
- Custom pricing and contracts
- Multiple stakeholders (buying committee)
- High-touch implementation
- Top-down adoption (exec sponsors deal)
- Significant pre-sale education

**When sales-led works:**
- ACV >$50K (often >$100K)
- Complex implementation or customization
- Multiple stakeholders in buying process
- High-touch customer success needed
- Regulated industries (finance, healthcare)
- Requires behavior change or transformation

**Examples:** Salesforce, SAP, Workday, enterprise software

---

### Hybrid (Most Common 2024)

**The Reality:** 75% of B2B SaaS companies use hybrid models

**Common hybrid approaches:**

**1. Product-Led Sales (PLS)**
- Free trial or freemium drives initial adoption
- Sales team engages when usage triggers occur
- Expansion from individual users to teams to enterprise
- Example: Atlassian, Dropbox Business

**2. Sales-Led with PLG Layer**
- Enterprise sales for large accounts
- Self-serve for SMB
- Two different go-to-market motions running in parallel
- Example: HubSpot, Monday.com

**3. Land with PLG, Expand with Sales**
- Users sign up self-serve
- Sales team engages for expansion deals
- Best of both: low CAC + high ACV
- Example: Slack (was), Zoom

## GTM Red Flags

- ❌ Can't differentiate in demo
- ❌ Product too simple (doesn't justify sales touch)
- ❌ No expansion opportunity

---

## GTM Evolution

### Most companies evolve their GTM:

**Year 1:** Pure PLG
- Free or low-price trial
- Self-serve only
- Optimize for activation

**Year 2:** Add sales layer
- Sales engages high-usage accounts
- Enterprise tier introduced
- Hybrid model begins

**Year 3+:** Mature hybrid
- PLG for SMB (80% of customers, 30% of revenue)
- Sales for enterprise (20% of customers, 70% of revenue)
- Different teams, different motions

**Example:** Slack started pure PLG, added sales layer at scale, eventually acquired by Salesforce (ultimate sales-led company)

---

## Testing Your GTM Assumptions

### Week 1-2 Launch: Test Core Assumptions

**Assumption 1: Target audience will discover us**
- Test: Track source of first 100 sign-ups
- Success: >70% from planned channels
- Fail: <30% from planned channels → revisit channel strategy

**Assumption 2: Messaging resonates**
- Test: Landing page conversion rate
- Success: >2% visitor → sign-up
- Fail: <1% → revisit messaging (use `messaging` skill)

**Assumption 3: Activation rate acceptable**
- Test: % who complete onboarding and reach "Aha moment"
- Success: >40% activation (PLG) or >60% (sales-led)
- Fail: <25% → fix onboarding

**Assumption 4: Unit economics work**
- Test: CAC vs LTV ratio
- Success: LTV:CAC >3:1
- Fail: LTV:CAC <2:1 → pricing or efficiency problem
