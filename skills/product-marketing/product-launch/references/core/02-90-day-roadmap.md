## Common Timeline Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Starting Too Late

**Problem:** Beginning 90-day plan only 60 days before desired launch date

**Impact:** Rushed execution, poor quality, team burnout

**Fix:** Launch date should be 90 days FROM start of planning, not FROM today

---

### Mistake 2: Compressing Beta Phase

**Problem:** Beta testing for only 1 week to save time

**Impact:** Major bugs discovered after launch, poor user experience

**Fix:** Minimum 2-week beta for Tier 2, 3-4 weeks for Tier 1

---

### Mistake 3: Content Created at Last Minute

**Problem:** Blog posts and videos created in final week

**Impact:** Poor quality, no time for revisions, stakeholder conflicts

**Fix:** All content should be complete 2 weeks before launch

---

### Mistake 4: No Buffer Time

**Problem:** Every day scheduled back-to-back with no slack

**Impact:** One delay cascades into everything else

**Fix:** Build 10-15% buffer time, especially around dependencies

---

## Adapting for Different Contexts

### B2B SaaS Launch
- **Longer sales cycles:** Allow for 6-12 month sales cycles post-launch
- **Enterprise beta:** Involve design partners early (3-6 months before launch)
- **Procurement:** Factor in security reviews, legal, procurement timelines

---

### Consumer Product Launch
- **Faster cycles:** Can compress timeline to 45-60 days
- **Viral mechanics:** Focus heavily on referral loops and sharing
- **App stores:** Add 1-2 weeks for Apple/Google review processes

---

### Developer Tools
- **Documentation heavy:** Allocate more time for API docs, SDKs
- **Community first:** Build on GitHub, Stack Overflow, Hacker News
- **Open beta:** Consider public beta on GitHub

---

## Next Steps

**After building your 90-day roadmap:**

- **Week 1:** Use this roadmap to create detailed project plan in Asana/Jira
- **Ongoing:** Review weekly with launch team, adjust as needed
- **Day 30/60 checkpoints:** Use checklist above for formal reviews
- **Post-launch:** Update this template based on learnings

**Key tools:**
- `assets/templates/90-day-roadmap.md` - Customizable template
- `04-cross-functional-coordination.md` - For RACI and team coordination
- `06-launch-day-playbook.md` - For launch day execution

**Remember:** This is a guide, not a prescription. Adapt based on your specific context, resources, and market.
