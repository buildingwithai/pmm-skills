# Launch Tier Framework

**Purpose:** Classify launches into tiers to allocate appropriate resources and prevent team burnout.

**When to use:** At the start of any product launch planning to determine scope and resources.

**Output:** Clear tier classification (1, 2, or 3) with resource allocation plan.

---

## Overview

Not all launches deserve equal investment. The launch tier framework helps you allocate resources appropriately and prevents the common mistake of treating every release as a major launch.

**Key insight:** Marketing teams can only handle **2 Tier 1 launches per quarter maximum**. Everything else must be Tier 2 or 3.

---

## The Three-Tier Framework

### Tier 1: "Scream" (Major Launch)

**Definition:** New product, new market entry, major repositioning, or transformative feature.

**Frequency:** Maximum 2 per quarter

**Full resources include:**
- Cross-functional launch team (PM, PMM, Sales, CS, Eng, Marketing)
- Dedicated budget ($50K-$500K+ depending on company size)
- 16-24 week timeline
- Executive sponsorship and visibility
- External PR and analyst relations
- Multi-channel marketing campaign
- Full sales enablement program
- Post-launch dedicated support

**Examples:**
- New product line launch
- Entering a new market or geography
- Major platform relaunch or rebrand
- Acquisition product integration
- Product-led to sales-led pivot (or vice versa)

**Success metrics (Week 1):**
- 500-2,500+ sign-ups
- 25-60% activation rate
- $5K-$25K+ MRR (B2B SaaS)
- 200-1,000+ Product Hunt upvotes
- 3-10+ press mentions

---

### Tier 2: "Shout" (Feature Launch)

**Definition:** Significant feature with revenue impact, retention driver, or competitive differentiator.

**Frequency:** 4-8 per quarter

**Selective resources include:**
- Core product marketing lead
- Targeted sales enablement (battlecards, one-pager)
- Blog post + social media
- Email to existing customers
- In-app announcements
- Basic analytics tracking
- 8-12 week timeline

**Examples:**
- Major feature that unlocks new use cases
- Features that impact pricing/packaging
- Competitive parity features
- Integration with popular platform
- Significant UX overhaul

**Success metrics (Week 1):**
- 10-40% feature adoption (existing users)
- 100-500+ new sign-ups
- $2K-$10K expansion MRR
- <20 support tickets
- +5 to +15 NPS impact

---

### Tier 3: "Whisper" (Incremental Update)

**Definition:** Maintenance releases, minor improvements, bug fixes, small features.

**Frequency:** Ongoing (as needed)

**Minimal resources:**
- PM writes release notes
- In-app notification or changelog
- Optional: Short social media post
- 1-4 week timeline (or immediate)

**Examples:**
- Bug fixes and performance improvements
- Minor UI tweaks
- Small workflow improvements
- API updates
- Compliance updates

**Success metrics (Week 1):**
- <10 bug reports
- 5-20% adoption rate
- Neutral to positive customer feedback
- Fast deployment (<24 hours)

## How to Determine Your Tier

### Decision Tree

Answer these questions in order:

**1. Does this launch acquire NEW customers or open NEW markets?**
- YES → Tier 1 candidate
- NO → Continue to question 2

**2. Does this significantly impact REVENUE or RETENTION?**
- YES → Tier 2 candidate
- NO → Continue to question 3

**3. Is this maintenance, bug fixes, or minor improvements?**
- YES → Tier 3
- NO → Re-evaluate questions 1-2

### Key Considerations

**Development effort ≠ Launch tier**

A feature that took 6 months to build might still be Tier 3 if it doesn't impact customers significantly.

**Customer impact = Launch tier**

Ask:
- Will customers notice and care?
- Does it change how they use the product?
- Does it impact their decision to buy or renew?
- Does it differentiate us competitively?

**When in doubt, tier DOWN**

Over-launching causes:
- Team burnout
- "Launch fatigue" with customers
- Reduced effectiveness of actual major launches
- Resource constraints for important releases

## Tier Framework in Practice

### Real Example: SaaS Company Launch Calendar (Q1)

**Tier 1 Launches (2 max):**
1. **New Enterprise Plan** (Week 2-16)
   - New pricing tier with advanced features
   - Full GTM strategy, sales enablement, multi-channel marketing
   - Resource allocation: 1 PMM (full-time), 60% marketing budget

2. **API v3 Launch** (Week 20-36)
   - Major platform upgrade, affects all developers
   - Developer relations, documentation overhaul, migration guides
   - Resource allocation: 1 PMM (full-time), 40% marketing budget

**Tier 2 Launches (6 in quarter):**
- Advanced analytics dashboard (Week 4)
- Slack integration (Week 8)
- SAML SSO (Week 12)
- Mobile app v2 (Week 16)
- Workflow automation (Week 20)
- Advanced permissions (Week 24)

**Tier 3 Launches (Ongoing):**
- Weekly bug fixes and performance improvements
- UI polish updates
- Minor feature improvements

**Result:** Team maintains sustainable pace, major launches get proper attention, customers aren't overwhelmed.

## Common Tier Determination Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Development Effort = Launch Tier

**Wrong thinking:** "We spent 6 months building this, it must be Tier 1"

**Reality:** If customers don't notice or care significantly, it's not Tier 1.

**Example:** Major backend infrastructure upgrade (6 months development) = Tier 3 launch (customers see faster performance but no new capabilities)

---

### Mistake 2: Everything is Tier 1

**Wrong thinking:** "Every release is important, we should go big on everything"

**Reality:** This leads to:
- Team burnout within 6 months
- "Launch fatigue" - customers ignore announcements
- Actual important launches get diluted
- No resources for true emergencies

**Fix:** Force rank. If everything is Tier 1, nothing is.

---

### Mistake 3: Tiering Based on Internal Politics

**Wrong thinking:** "The CEO's pet project must be Tier 1"

**Reality:** Tier should be based on customer and business impact, not internal politics.

**Solution:** Use objective criteria:
- New customer acquisition potential
- Revenue impact (new or expansion)
- Retention/churn impact
- Competitive differentiation
- Market positioning

---

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Quarterly Capacity

**Wrong thinking:** "We have 5 major launches this quarter, we'll just work harder"

**Reality:** Quality suffers, team burns out, launches fail.

**Fix:** Hard limit of 2 Tier 1 launches per quarter. Defer or downgrade others.

---

## Changing Tiers Mid-Planning

Sometimes you need to adjust tier classification:

### Upgrading from Tier 2 → Tier 1

**Valid reasons:**
- Competitive landscape shifted (new entrant requires response)
- Customer demand exceeded expectations
- Executive decision to prioritize based on new data
- Market opportunity opened up unexpectedly

**Requirements:**
- Extend timeline (add 8-12 weeks minimum)
- Allocate full resources retroactively
- Communicate change to all stakeholders
- Ensure you haven't exceeded 2 Tier 1 launches for quarter

---

### Downgrading from Tier 1 → Tier 2

**Valid reasons:**
- Market research shows lower demand than expected
- Resource constraints (other priority emerged)
- Feature not ready for major launch
- Competitive intel suggests different timing

**Requirements:**
- Communicate early to stakeholders
- Adjust expectations on outcomes
- Reallocate resources to other priorities
- Document rationale for future reference

---

## Solopreneur vs Enterprise Tier Framework

### Solopreneur Considerations

**Tier 1 for solopreneurs:**
- Typically 1 per year maximum
- Timeline: 8-12 weeks (compressed)
- Resources: Personal time + $5K-$20K budget
- Focus: Product Hunt, community, organic channels
- AI tools level the playing field (content, design, support)

**Reality check:** As a solopreneur, you can't afford many Tier 1 launches. Pick your moments carefully.

**Solopreneur tier criteria:**
- Tier 1: New product or major pivot
- Tier 2: Significant feature that unlocks new market
- Tier 3: Everything else (ship fast, iterate)

---

### Enterprise Considerations

**Tier 1 for enterprise:**
- Multiple teams coordinated
- Executive visibility required
- Analyst relations and PR critical
- Global rollout considerations
- Compliance and legal reviews

**Additional complexity:**
- Regional launches (EMEA, APAC)
- Vertical-specific messaging
- Enterprise sales cycles (6-12 months)
- Customer advisory board input
- Beta programs with Fortune 500

**Resource multiplier:** Enterprise Tier 1 launches often require 3-5x the resources of SMB launches.

## Quarter Planning with Tier Framework

### Quarterly Launch Planning Process

**Week 1: Inventory all potential launches**
- List everything product/eng is building
- Include marketing/positioning initiatives
- Don't tier yet, just list

**Week 2: Tier classification workshop**
- Use decision tree for each item
- Apply tier checklists
- Force rank within each tier
- Identify conflicts (too many Tier 1s)

**Week 3: Resource allocation**
- Assign PMM and marketing resources
- Identify gaps (need to hire? need agency?)
- Create launch calendar
- Communicate capacity constraints

**Week 4: Finalize and communicate**
- Executive alignment on tiers
- Share calendar with all stakeholders
- Set expectations on outcomes
- Plan for quarterly reviews

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Maximum 2 Tier 1 launches per quarter** - This is non-negotiable for team health

2. **Customer impact determines tier** - Not development effort, not internal politics

3. **Tier down when uncertain** - Over-launching causes more harm than under-launching

4. **Resource allocation must match tier** - Don't do Tier 1 with Tier 2 resources

5. **Tiers can change** - But only with good reason and early communication

6. **Solopreneurs need even stricter limits** - 1 Tier 1 per year maximum

7. **Document your rationale** - Helps with future tier decisions and stakeholder management

## Next Steps

**After determining your tier:**

- **Tier 1:** Read `02-90-day-roadmap.md` for full planning timeline
- **Tier 2:** Skip to `03-gtm-strategy.md` for focused planning
- **Tier 3:** Skip to `05-multi-channel-tactics.md` for lightweight execution

**Questions to answer before moving on:**
