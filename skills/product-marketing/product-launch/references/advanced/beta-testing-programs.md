# Beta Testing Programs

**Purpose:** Design and execute beta programs to validate product, gather feedback, and build launch momentum.

**When to use:** Days 22-45 of 90-day roadmap (before full launch).

**Output:** Beta program plan, participant recruitment, feedback synthesis, and testimonials.

---

## Overview

Beta testing is the bridge between internal development and public launch. It's your chance to catch critical issues, validate positioning, and build early advocates.

**Key principle:** Beta is not just QA. It's validation of product-market fit, messaging, onboarding, and pricing.

**2024 reality:** Best betas are small (50-100 users), focused, and time-boxed (2-4 weeks).

---

## Types of Beta Programs

### 1. Closed Beta (Private, Invite-Only)

**Definition:** Limited group of hand-selected users test product before public release

**Best for:**
- Early-stage products (MVP testing)
- High-risk launches (enterprise, mission-critical)
- Building exclusivity and demand
- Deep feedback from qualified users

**Size:** 20-100 users

**Duration:** 2-4 weeks

**Examples:**
- Superhuman (invite-only beta for 2 years, 275K waitlist)
- Clubhouse (invite-only created FOMO, viral growth)
- Gmail (invite-only in 2004, created scarcity)

---

### 2. Open Beta (Public, Anyone Can Join)

**Definition:** Public beta where anyone can sign up and test product

**Best for:**
- PLG products (high-volume testing)
- Developer tools (community feedback)
- Building waitlist and momentum
- Stress-testing infrastructure

**Size:** 500-5,000+ users

**Duration:** 4-8 weeks

**Examples:**
- GitHub (public beta, community-driven feedback)
- Notion (long public beta, iterated based on feedback)
- Figma (public beta, design community engaged early)

---

### 3. Design Partner Beta (B2B Enterprise)

**Definition:** Small number of strategic customers co-create product with deep involvement

**Best for:**
- Enterprise B2B products
- Complex, customized solutions
- Long sales cycles (6-12 months)
- Building case studies and references

**Size:** 3-10 companies

**Duration:** 3-6 months

**Examples:**
- Snowflake (design partners from finance, tech)
- Databricks (co-created with data teams at large enterprises)
- Amplitude (product analytics, built with Dropbox, Instacart)

---

## Beta Recruitment

### Recruiting Closed Beta (20-100 users)

**Where to find beta users:**

**1. Existing customers (if you have a product already):**
- Email best customers (high engagement, NPS Promoters)
- Offer early access to new feature/product
- Incentivize with discounts or credits

**2. Email list or waitlist:**
- If you've been building a waitlist, pick top engagers

---

**5. Partnerships:**

- Cross-promote beta to each other's audiences
- Win-win for both sides

---

### Beta Application Form

**Keep it short (5-7 questions max):**

**Example beta application:**

1. **Email:** _________
2. **Name:** _________
3. **What problem are you trying to solve?** (open text)
4. **What tools do you currently use for this?** (open text)
5. **How often do you face this problem?** (Daily / Weekly / Monthly / Rarely)

**Why these questions:**
- Q3-4: Qualify if they're ICP (ideal customer profile)
- Q5: Frequency = urgency (daily users are best beta testers)
- Q6: Segment by company size
- Q7: Identify power users for interviews

## Common Beta Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Beta Too Long

**Problem:** 3-6 month beta with no clear end date

**Impact:** Users lose interest, feedback quality drops, momentum dies

**Fix:** Time-box beta to 2-4 weeks max. Create urgency.

---

### Mistake 2: No Clear Goals

**Problem:** "Let's get feedback" without specific goals

**Impact:** Unfocused feedback, unclear what to prioritize, wasted time

**Fix:** Define 1-2 specific goals (e.g., validate messaging, test core flow, gather testimonials)

---

### Mistake 3: Too Many Beta Users

**Problem:** 5,000 beta users, impossible to manage feedback

**Impact:** Overwhelmed, feedback ignored, users feel unheard

**Fix:** Keep it small (20-100 for closed, 500-1,000 for open max)

---

### Mistake 4: No Feedback Loop Closure

**Problem:** Collect feedback but never share what you did with it

**Impact:** Users stop giving feedback, feel ignored, churn

**Fix:** Weekly updates: "You said X, we fixed Y, here's what's next"

---

### Mistake 5: Treating Beta as QA

**Problem:** Using beta only for bug testing

**Impact:** Miss opportunity to validate positioning, messaging, pricing, product-market fit

**Fix:** Beta is strategic validation, not just QA. Ask bigger questions.

---

## Next Steps
