# Failed Launch Recovery

**Purpose:** Diagnose failed launches and execute recovery strategies to salvage momentum.

**When to use:** When Week 1-4 metrics significantly underperform targets (>50% miss).

**Output:** Diagnosis, recovery plan, and pivot strategy.

---

## Overview

Most launches don't meet initial expectations. That's normal. But some launches fail dramatically—and recovery is possible if you act fast.

**Key principle:** Failed launches are learning opportunities. The faster you diagnose and adapt, the better your chances of recovery.

**2024 reality:** 40-60% of product launches miss initial targets. Only 10-20% recover successfully. The difference is speed and willingness to pivot.

## Defining Launch Failure

### Types of Launch Failure

**Type 1: Metrics Miss (Underperformance)**

**Symptoms:**
- Week 1 sign-ups: 200 (target: 1,000) = 80% miss
- Activation rate: 15% (target: 40%) = 63% miss
- Day 7 retention: 10% (target: 35%) = 71% miss
- MRR: $1K (target: $10K) = 90% miss

**Severity:** Moderate to High

**Prognosis:** Recoverable with rapid iteration

---

**Type 2: No Traction (Dead on Arrival)**

**Symptoms:**
- <50 sign-ups in Week 1
- <5% activation rate
- No organic sharing or word-of-mouth
- No press coverage despite outreach
- Zero paying customers

**Severity:** High

**Prognosis:** Requires fundamental pivot (positioning, product, or market)

---

**Type 3: Negative Reception (Backlash)**

**Symptoms:**
- Negative social media sentiment (ratio'd on Twitter)
- Low NPS (<0, more detractors than promoters)
- Public criticism from influencers or press
- High churn (50%+ Day 7 churn)
- Angry support tickets

**Severity:** Critical

**Prognosis:** Requires crisis management + fundamental changes

---

**Type 4: Technical Failure (Broken Product)**

**Symptoms:**
- Site down or major outages
- Critical bugs prevent core use
- Data loss or security breach
- Can't handle traffic (crashes under load)

**Severity:** Critical

**Prognosis:** Fix immediately or shut down until stable

---

## Failure Diagnosis Framework

### The 5 Whys (Root Cause Analysis)

**Process:** Ask "Why?" five times to get to root cause

**Example 1: Low Sign-Ups**

1. **Why did we miss sign-up targets?**
   - Traffic was 50% below target

2. **Why was traffic low?**
   - Product Hunt launch ranked #15 (not top 5)

3. **Why did we rank poorly on Product Hunt?**
   - Only 80 upvotes in first 6 hours (needed 300+)

4. **Why didn't we get upvotes?**
   - Launch crew didn't show up (only 20% engaged)

5. **Why didn't launch crew engage?**
   - We didn't build relationships beforehand, just spammed requests

**Root cause:** Poor pre-launch community building

**Fix:** Can't undo PH launch, but can build community for next channel push

---

**Example 2: Low Activation**

1. **Why is activation rate only 15%?**
   - 85% of users drop off during onboarding

2. **Why do users drop off during onboarding?**
   - Onboarding has 12 steps, takes 30+ minutes

3. **Why does onboarding take so long?**
   - We ask for too much information upfront (company, role, use case, integrations, settings)

4. **Why do we ask for all this upfront?**
   - We thought we needed it for personalization

5. **Why don't we collect it later?**
   - We didn't consider progressive onboarding

**Root cause:** Onboarding friction (too many steps)

**Fix:** Reduce onboarding to 3 steps, collect additional info later

---

### Failure Matrix (Diagnose Specific Issue)

| Symptom | Root Cause | Fix |
|---------|------------|-----|
| **Low traffic** | Wrong channels, poor messaging | Change channels, improve messaging |
| **Low sign-ups** | Weak value prop, confusing landing page | Clarify value prop, A/B test landing page |
| **Low activation** | Onboarding friction, unclear value | Simplify onboarding, show value faster |
| **Low retention** | Product doesn't deliver value | Improve core product, validate PMF |
| **Low conversion** | Pricing too high, weak paid tier value | Adjust pricing, improve packaging |
| **Negative sentiment** | Messaging misalignment, broken promises | Apologize, fix issues, reset expectations |
| **Technical failures** | Infrastructure not ready | Pause launch, fix bugs, relaunch |

## Recovery Strategies by Failure Type

### Recovery Strategy 1: Metrics Miss (Moderate Failure)

**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks to recovery

**Action plan:**

**Week 1: Rapid Diagnosis**
- [ ] Pull full funnel metrics (acquisition → activation → retention → revenue)
- [ ] Identify biggest drop-off point (biggest leak in funnel)
- [ ] Interview 10-20 users (activated and churned)
- [ ] Watch 50+ session recordings
- [ ] Synthesize feedback themes

**Week 2: Rapid Iteration Sprint**
- [ ] Fix top 3 issues identified in diagnosis
- [ ] Simplify onboarding (reduce steps by 50%)
- [ ] Improve messaging on landing page
- [ ] Ship daily improvements
- [ ] Re-engage churned users ("We fixed X based on your feedback")

**Week 3: Channel Pivot**
- [ ] Double down on best-performing channel
- [ ] Test 2-3 new channels
- [ ] Improve conversion funnel
- [ ] A/B test messaging variations
- [ ] Increase budget for working channels

**Week 4: Validate Recovery**
- [ ] Compare Week 4 metrics to Week 1
- [ ] Target: 20-50% improvement in key metrics
- [ ] If improving, continue iteration
- [ ] If not improving, consider fundamental pivot

**Success criteria:**
- Week 4 sign-ups 2x Week 1
- Activation rate improves 10-15 percentage points
- Positive user feedback on improvements

---

### Recovery Strategy 2: No Traction (High Failure)

**Timeline:** 4-8 weeks to recovery (or pivot decision)

**Action plan:**

**Week 1-2: Validate Product-Market Fit**
- [ ] Interview 20-30 target customers (not just users who signed up)
- [ ] Ask: "What's the biggest problem you face with [use case]?"
- [ ] Ask: "How do you solve it today?"
- [ ] Ask: "What would an ideal solution look like?"
- [ ] Ask: "Would you pay for that solution? How much?"

**Diagnosis questions:**
- Are we solving a real, painful problem?
- Are we solving it for the right people?
- Is our solution 10x better than alternatives?
- Is our messaging communicating the value clearly?

**Possible outcomes:**

**Outcome A: Problem is real, solution is wrong**
- Pivot product to better solve validated problem
- Timeline: 4-8 weeks to rebuild

**Outcome B: Problem is real, targeting wrong audience**
- Pivot positioning and messaging to right audience
- Timeline: 2-4 weeks to relaunch

**Outcome C: Problem isn't painful enough**
- Pivot to different problem or shut down
- Timeline: 1-2 weeks to decide

**Outcome D: Solution is right, messaging is wrong**
- Fix positioning and messaging
- Timeline: 2-4 weeks to iterate

---

### Recovery Strategy 3: Negative Reception (Critical Failure)

**Timeline:** Immediate action required (24-48 hours)

**Crisis management playbook:**

**Hour 1-6: Acknowledge and Assess**
- [ ] Publicly acknowledge the issue (Twitter, blog post)
- [ ] Apologize if you screwed up (be authentic, not defensive)
- [ ] Assess severity (is this a PR crisis or just criticism?)
- [ ] Assemble crisis team (CEO, PMM, PR, Legal)

**Example acknowledgment (Twitter):**
```
"We hear you. Our launch messaging was tone-deaf and we're sorry. We're taking the following immediate actions: [list]. More details in 24 hours."
```

**Hour 6-24: Fix What's Broken**
- [ ] Identify the core issue (what specifically went wrong?)
- [ ] Fix it immediately (pull messaging, fix bug, change policy)
- [ ] Communicate fixes transparently (blog post)
- [ ] Reach out to critics individually (DM, email, apologize)

**Day 2-7: Rebuild Trust**
- [ ] Share detailed post-mortem (what happened, why, how we'll prevent it)
- [ ] Implement changes based on feedback
- [ ] Engage constructively with criticism (don't delete, don't be defensive)
- [ ] Consider "reset" launch (if issue was messaging/positioning)

**Example post-mortem format:**

**Subject: "What we got wrong and how we're fixing it"**

1. **What happened:** [Honest description of failure]
2. **Why it happened:** [Root cause, no excuses]
3. **What we're changing:** [Specific actions]
4. **How we'll prevent this:** [Process changes]
5. **What's next:** [Path forward]

**Success criteria:**
- Shift from negative to neutral/constructive conversation
- NPS improves from negative to neutral within 2 weeks
- User churn stabilizes

---

### Recovery Strategy 4: Technical Failure (Critical Failure)

**Timeline:** Immediate (do not pass Go, do not collect $200)

**Action plan:**

**Immediate (Hour 1):**
- [ ] Assess severity (Is site down? Data lost? Security breach?)
- [ ] Communicate to users (Twitter, email, status page)
- [ ] Pause all marketing (stop driving traffic to broken product)
- [ ] Activate engineering team (all-hands to fix)

**Communication template:**

**Subject: "[Product] experiencing technical issues"**

**Body:**
```
We're currently experiencing technical issues with [Product]. Our team is working on a fix.

**What's affected:** [Specific features/functionality]

**Estimated resolution:** [Timeframe or "investigating"]

**What you can do:** [Workaround if available, or "please wait"]

We'll update you every [X hours] until resolved.

Apologies for the disruption.

[Your Name]
[Product] Team

Status page: [link]
```

**Hour 1-6: Triage and Fix**
- [ ] Identify root cause
- [ ] Deploy fix (if possible)
- [ ] Or roll back to previous stable version
- [ ] Test thoroughly before re-enabling
- [ ] Communicate progress every 1-2 hours

**Hour 6-24: Validate and Communicate**
- [ ] Confirm fix is stable
- [ ] Gradually re-enable traffic (10% → 50% → 100%)
- [ ] Monitor error rates and performance
- [ ] Send "All clear" email to users
- [ ] Offer compensation (extended trial, credit, refund)

**Day 2-7: Post-Mortem and Prevention**
- [ ] Write detailed post-mortem (technical + user-facing)
- [ ] Identify prevention measures (better testing, monitoring, alerts)
- [ ] Implement improvements
- [ ] Rebuild user trust

**Success criteria:**
- Issue resolved <24 hours
- Users compensated fairly
- Measures in place to prevent recurrence

## Pivot Strategies

### Pivot Type 1: Audience Pivot

**When:** Product is solid but wrong audience

**Example:**
- **Original:** Built for CMOs at enterprise companies
- **Pivot:** Actually used by marketing ops managers at mid-market

**Action plan:**
- [ ] Rewrite positioning for new audience
- [ ] Update messaging (pain points, language, examples)
- [ ] Change marketing channels (LinkedIn vs. Product Hunt)
- [ ] Rebuild case studies and testimonials
- [ ] Relaunch to new audience

**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks

**Success:** 2-3x better activation and retention with new audience

---

### Pivot Type 2: Use Case Pivot

**When:** Product is used differently than intended

**Example:**
- **Original:** Built as project management tool
- **Pivot:** Actually used as client collaboration tool

**Action plan:**
- [ ] Interview users to understand actual use case
- [ ] Adjust product roadmap to support actual use case
- [ ] Rewrite positioning around actual use case
- [ ] Update onboarding to guide users to actual use case
- [ ] Relaunch with new positioning

**Timeline:** 4-8 weeks

**Success:** Users onboard faster and retain better

---

### Pivot Type 3: Pricing Pivot

**When:** Product is good but price is wrong

**Example:**
- **Original:** $299/mo (too expensive for SMBs)
- **Pivot:** $49/mo Starter, $149/mo Pro, $299/mo Enterprise

**Action plan:**
- [ ] Analyze churn reasons (pricing objections?)
- [ ] Survey users on willingness to pay
- [ ] Introduce lower-priced tier
- [ ] Grandfather existing customers
- [ ] Relaunch with new pricing

**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks

**Success:** 2-5x increase in conversion rate

---

### Pivot Type 4: Channel Pivot

**When:** Product is good but wrong distribution channel

**Example:**
- **Original:** PLG (self-serve, Product Hunt, content)
- **Pivot:** Sales-led (enterprise outbound, demos, custom pricing)

**Action plan:**
- [ ] Identify where best customers are coming from
- [ ] Build new channel strategy
- [ ] Allocate resources (hire sales, build content, etc.)
- [ ] Test new channels in parallel
- [ ] Shift budget to working channels

**Timeline:** 4-8 weeks

**Success:** CAC improves, LTV increases

---

### Pivot Type 5: Product Pivot

**When:** Product doesn't solve problem well enough

**Example:**
- **Original:** Full project management suite (too complex)
- **Pivot:** Simple task management tool (focused)

**Action plan:**
- [ ] Identify core value (what do users love?)
- [ ] Cut everything else (ruthless simplification)
- [ ] Rebuild focused product
- [ ] Beta test with existing users
- [ ] Relaunch as "new, focused [Product]"

**Timeline:** 8-16 weeks

**Success:** Activation and retention dramatically improve

---

## Relaunch Strategy

### When to Relaunch (vs. Iterate)

**Relaunch when:**
- Major product changes (justify fresh launch)
- New positioning/audience (different market)
- Negative perception from first launch (need reset)
- 3+ months since first launch (enough time to rebuild)

**Don't relaunch when:**
- Minor iterations (just ship updates)
- Less than 1 month since first launch (too soon)
- No fundamental changes (users will notice)

---

### Relaunch Playbook

**8 weeks before relaunch:**
- [ ] Complete pivot (product, positioning, messaging)
- [ ] Beta test with 50-100 users
- [ ] Gather testimonials from beta
- [ ] Build case studies

**4 weeks before relaunch:**
- [ ] Create new marketing assets
- [ ] Build new launch crew (don't assume first group will return)
- [ ] Prep new channels
- [ ] Update website and materials

**2 weeks before relaunch:**
- [ ] Email existing users: "We listened to your feedback, here's what's new"
- [ ] Tease relaunch on social media
- [ ] Prep press outreach (if applicable)
- [ ] Finalize launch day playbook

**Relaunch Day:**
- [ ] Execute launch day playbook (see `06-launch-day-playbook.md`)
- [ ] Emphasize "new and improved" messaging
- [ ] Highlight what changed based on feedback
- [ ] Monitor metrics obsessively

**Post-relaunch:**
- [ ] Compare to first launch metrics (are we improving?)
- [ ] Iterate rapidly based on feedback
- [ ] Don't make same mistakes twice

**Success criteria:**
- Relaunch metrics 2-5x better than first launch
- Positive user sentiment
- Sustainable growth trajectory

## Common Recovery Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Waiting Too Long

**Problem:** Watching metrics decline for 4-8 weeks before acting

**Impact:** Momentum dies, team morale crashes, harder to recover

**Fix:** Act within Week 1-2 of identifying failure

---

### Mistake 2: Denial

**Problem:** Blaming external factors ("wrong timing," "algorithm changes," "bad luck")

**Impact:** Miss root cause, repeat same mistakes

**Fix:** Honest diagnosis. Usually it's product, positioning, or execution—not bad luck.

---

### Mistake 3: Changing Everything at Once

**Problem:** Pivot product, pricing, positioning, and channels simultaneously

**Impact:** Can't isolate what worked, create new problems

**Fix:** Change one thing at a time, measure, iterate

---

### Mistake 4: Giving Up Too Soon

**Problem:** Shutting down after Week 1 underperformance

**Impact:** Miss opportunity to learn and recover

**Fix:** Give it 4-8 weeks of rapid iteration before calling it

---

### Mistake 5: Not Learning from Failure

**Problem:** Move on to next product without retrospective

**Impact:** Repeat same mistakes on next launch

**Fix:** Document lessons learned, share with team, update playbooks

---

## Case Studies: Successful Launch Recoveries

### Case Study 1: Slack (2013-2014)

**Original launch:** Internal tool for gaming company (Tiny Speck)

**Failure:** Gaming company failed, tool had no clear market

**Pivot:** Repurposed internal tool as team communication product

**Recovery actions:**
- Focused on "email killer" positioning
- Targeted tech startups (early adopters)
- Nailed onboarding (2,000 messages = team is hooked)
- Built viral growth loops (invite teammates)

**Outcome:** 15,000 users in 2 weeks post-relaunch, acquired by Salesforce for $27.7B

**Lesson:** Internal tool → external product pivot can work

---

### Case Study 2: Instagram (2010)

**Original launch:** Burbn (location check-in app, like Foursquare)

**Failure:** No traction, too complex, too many features

**Pivot:** Stripped down to photo sharing only (one core feature)

**Recovery actions:**
- Removed all features except photo sharing and filters
- Renamed to Instagram
- iOS exclusive (quality over quantity)
- Relaunched in App Store

**Outcome:** 25,000 users Day 1, acquired by Facebook for $1B

**Lesson:** Simplify ruthlessly. Do one thing exceptionally well.

---

### Case Study 3: YouTube (2005)

**Original launch:** Video dating site

**Failure:** No users, no videos, no traction

**Pivot:** General video sharing platform

**Recovery actions:**
- Opened up to any video content (not just dating)
- Made embedding easy (viral distribution)
- Focused on user-generated content
- Paid early creators to post content

**Outcome:** Acquired by Google for $1.65B in 2006

**Lesson:** Be willing to pivot from original vision entirely

---

---

## Next Steps

**If your launch failed:**
1. Don't panic. 40-60% of launches underperform. You're not alone.
2. Diagnose quickly (Week 1-2)
3. Iterate rapidly (Week 2-4)
4. Decide: recover, pivot, or shut down (Week 4-8)
5. Document learnings for next launch

**Related guides:**
- `07-metrics-optimization.md` - Identifying metric failures
- `08-iteration-retrospective.md` - Rapid iteration frameworks
- `02-90-day-roadmap.md` - Post-launch timeline
- `advanced/beta-testing-programs.md` - Preventing failure with beta

**Remember:** Failed launches are not failed careers. Every successful product has a story of early struggles. What matters is how you respond.
