# International Expansion & Market-Specific Launches

**Purpose:** Plan and execute product launches in new geographic markets and international expansion.

**When to use:** After successful domestic launch, when considering international growth.

**Output:** Market entry strategy, localization plan, and market-specific GTM tactics.

---

## Overview

International expansion is not just translating your website. It's adapting positioning, messaging, GTM, pricing, and product for different markets.

**Key principle:** Launch globally is a myth. Launch market-by-market with tailored strategies.

**2024 reality:** 70% of global internet users are non-English speakers. 75% of consumers prefer to buy in their native language (CSA Research).

---

## When to Expand Internationally

### Pre-Requisites for International Expansion

**Don't expand until you have:**
- ✅ Product-market fit in home market (NPS > +30, retention stable)
- ✅ Repeatable acquisition playbook (know what works)
- ✅ Profitable unit economics (LTV:CAC > 3:1)
- ✅ Resources to support new market (team, budget, infrastructure)
- ✅ Customer demand signals from target market (inbound requests, organic sign-ups)

**Red flags (don't expand yet):**
- ❌ Still iterating product in home market
- ❌ Burning cash with no path to profitability
- ❌ Can't support home market customers well
- ❌ No demand signals from new market

**Common mistake:** Expanding internationally to escape poor domestic performance. Fix home market first.

---

### Demand Signals to Watch

**Green lights (expand now):**
- 10-20%+ of organic sign-ups from target market
- Inbound requests for local currency, language, support
- Community activity from target market (Reddit, Twitter)
- Competitor traction in target market
- Total addressable market (TAM) large enough

**Example:**
- 15% of sign-ups from Germany
- 30+ support tickets asking for German language
- Competitors expanding to DACH region
- → Strong signal to launch in Germany

---

## Pricing Strategy for International Markets

### Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) Pricing

**Concept:** Adjust pricing based on local purchasing power to maintain affordability

**Formula:** Local price = US price × (Local PPP / US PPP)

**Example:**
- US price: $99/mo
- India PPP: 0.35 (1/3 of US purchasing power)
- India price: $99 × 0.35 = $35/mo

**When to use:**
- Emerging markets (India, Brazil, Indonesia, etc.)
- Price-sensitive markets
- High competition from local low-cost alternatives

**When not to use:**
- Premium positioning (same price worldwide signals premium)
- Risk of arbitrage (US customers buy through Indian entity)
- Small markets (not worth complexity)

---

### Currency Considerations

**Should you show local currency?**

**Yes, if:**
- ✅ Significant user base from market (>10%)
- ✅ Long-term commitment to market
- ✅ Accept local payment methods
- ✅ Have local entity (for invoicing)

**No, if:**
- ❌ Testing market (use USD first)
- ❌ Small user base (<5%)
- ❌ Only accept credit cards (automatically converts)

**Best practice:** Show prices in local currency but collect in USD initially (payment processor handles conversion)

**FX buffers:** Add 10-15% to converted price to account for FX volatility

**Example:**
- USD price: $99/mo
- EUR conversion: €90 (direct conversion)
- EUR price: €99 (10% buffer for FX fluctuation)

---

## Compliance & Legal Considerations

### GDPR (EU + UK + EEA)

**Requirements:**
- User consent for data collection
- Right to access data
- Right to be forgotten (data deletion)
- Data breach notification (within 72 hours)
- Data Processing Agreement (DPA) with vendors
- EU/UK data residency (for some industries)

**Tools:**
- Cookie consent banners (Cookiebot, OneTrust)
- GDPR-compliant analytics (Plausible, Fathom)
- DPA templates (Termly, iubenda)

**Penalties:** Up to €20M or 4% of global revenue (whichever is higher)

---

### CCPA (California, USA)

**Requirements:**
- Right to know what data is collected
- Right to delete data
- Right to opt-out of data sales
- Privacy policy must disclose data practices

**Who it applies to:** Companies with >$25M revenue, or >50K CA residents data, or >50% revenue from data sales

---

### Other Regional Regulations

**Brazil (LGPD):**
- Similar to GDPR
- Applies to any company processing Brazilian user data

**China (PIPL - Personal Information Protection Law):**
- Very strict data localization requirements
- Local entity required
- Government access to data
- Consider: Is China worth it given compliance burden?

**Australia (Privacy Act):**
- Less strict than GDPR
- Notifiable data breaches
- Privacy policy required

## Common International Expansion Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Translating, Not Localizing

**Problem:** Use Google Translate for website, sounds robotic

**Impact:** Low trust, poor conversion, brand damage

**Fix:** Hire professional translators who are native speakers and understand your industry

---

### Mistake 2: Ignoring Cultural Nuances

**Problem:** Same positioning, messaging, sales tactics across all markets

**Impact:** Messaging doesn't resonate, sales cycles differ, churn

**Fix:** Adapt positioning and GTM for each market based on research

---

### Mistake 3: Expanding Too Many Markets at Once

**Problem:** Launch in 5 countries simultaneously

**Impact:** Spread too thin, can't support any well, all fail

**Fix:** Launch one market at a time, validate, then expand

---

### Mistake 4: No Local Presence

**Problem:** Serve European customers from US team only (time zone mismatch)

**Impact:** Slow response times, poor customer experience, churn

**Fix:** Hire local support or have coverage during local business hours

---

### Mistake 5: Underestimating Compliance

**Problem:** Launch in EU without GDPR compliance

**Impact:** Fines, legal issues, forced shutdown

**Fix:** Compliance BEFORE launch, not after

---

## Next Steps

**If considering international expansion:**

1. **Validate demand** (analyze existing users, run ads, interviews)
2. **Select first market** (use market prioritization matrix)
3. **Choose localization level** (translation, localization, market adaptation, or full presence)
4. **Plan 4-phase approach** (validation → localization → beta → launch)
5. **Budget appropriately** ($10K-$500K depending on market and level)

**Related guides:**
- `02-90-day-roadmap.md` - Adapt timeline for international launch
- `03-gtm-strategy.md` - Market-specific GTM strategies
- `06-launch-day-playbook.md` - Execute launch in new market
- `07-metrics-optimization.md` - Compare metrics across markets

**Remember:** International expansion is a marathon, not a sprint. Launch small, learn fast, scale intentionally.
