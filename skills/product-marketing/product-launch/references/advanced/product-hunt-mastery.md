## Product Hunt Fundamentals

### How Product Hunt Works (2024-2025)

**Daily ranking system:**
- Products launch 12:01am PST (Pacific Time)
- Ranked by upvotes throughout the day
- Top 5 at end of day (11:59pm PST) get most visibility
- "Product of the Day" = #1 product
- "Product of the Week/Month" = best performers

**Voting mechanics:**
- One upvote per user per product
- Votes from "Hunters" (PH power users) count more
- Early votes matter more (velocity algorithm)
- Comments and engagement boost visibility

**Key changes in 2024:**
- Video demos now auto-play on listing (use this!)
- "Golden Kitty Awards" categories expanded
- Mobile app drives 40% of traffic (optimize for mobile)
- AI products dominate (ChatGPT integrations popular)

## Pre-Launch Preparation (4-8 weeks before)

### Week -8 to -4: Build Your Hunter Profile

**Why it matters:** Your personal PH profile affects launch success.

**Profile optimization:**
1. **Create account** (if you don't have one)
2. **Complete profile:**
   - Professional headshot
   - Bio (2-3 sentences about what you build)
   - Twitter/LinkedIn links
   - Website
3. **Build reputation:**
   - Upvote 5-10 products daily
   - Leave thoughtful comments (not spam)
   - Follow relevant makers and hunters
   - Engage authentically for 2-4 weeks

**Reputation building tactics:**
- Comment on products in your space (show expertise)
- Congratulate makers on successful launches
- Share useful feedback (not just "great product!")
- Build relationships, don't just promote

---

### Week -4 to -2: Prepare Assets

**Required assets:**

**1. Product listing page:**
- **Tagline:** 60 characters max (clear, concise value prop)
  - Good: "Turn screenshots into interactive demos in minutes"
  - Bad: "The best tool for product demos and screenshots"
- **Description:** 260 characters (expand on tagline)
- **First comment:** Your launch story (see template below)
- **Gallery:** 3-8 images or videos
  - First image: Hero shot (most important)
  - Subsequent: Feature screenshots, use cases
  - Video: 30-60 second demo (auto-plays!)
- **Links:**
  - Website (optimized landing page)
  - Optional: Twitter, Discord, blog post
- **Topics:** Choose 3-5 relevant tags
- **Maker profile:** Complete your maker info

**2. Launch video (30-60 seconds):**
- **First 3 seconds:** Hook (show the problem or result)
- **10-30 seconds:** Quick feature walkthrough
- **Last 5 seconds:** CTA (sign up, try free, etc.)
- **Technical specs:** 16:9 aspect ratio, MP4, <10MB
- **Tools:** Loom, Descript, ScreenFlow, or iPhone
- **Pro tip:** Add captions (50% watch muted)

**3. First comment (your launch story):**

**Template:**
```

**The problem:**

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Rahul, CEO of Superhuman. We're on a mission to make email brilliant.

**The problem:**

**Our solution:**
Superhuman is the fastest email experience ever made. Blazingly fast, beautiful, and packed with features that make you feel superhuman.

**Why we built this:**
I was spending 4+ hours/day in email and still felt behind. I dreamed of an email client as fast as my thoughts. So we built it.

**What makes us different:**
• ⚡ 100ms interactions (faster than the blink of an eye)
• ⌨️ Keyboard shortcuts for everything (mouse not needed)
• 📧 Undo send, snooze, send later (email superpowers)

**Special offer for PH community:**
First month free + priority onboarding (normally $30/month)

We've been in beta for 2 years with 275,000 people on our waitlist. Today we're opening up. Would love your feedback!

Rahul

## Advanced Product Hunt Tactics

### Tactic 1: Hunter Outreach

**What is a "Hunter"?** Established PH community member who "hunts" (submits) products on behalf of makers.

**Why use a Hunter:**
- Their followers get notified
- Adds credibility (vetting signal)
- Larger initial audience

**Top hunters (2024):**
- Chris Messina (@chrismessina) - 98K followers
- Kevin William David (@kwdinc) - 45K followers
- Hiten Shah (@hnshah) - 34K followers
- Ryan Hoover (@rrhoover) - PH founder, rarely hunts now

**How to get hunted:**
1. Build relationship first (don't cold email)
2. Engage with their PH activity
3. Reach out 2-4 weeks before launch
4. Provide demo access
5. Make it easy for them (provide assets)

**Outreach template:**

**Subject:** "Would you consider hunting [Product] on PH?"

**Body:**
```
Hey [Hunter Name],

I'm [Your Name], founder of [Product]. I've been following your Product Hunt activity and love the products you've hunted (especially [specific product]).

We're launching [Product] on Product Hunt in [timeframe]. It's [one-sentence description].

Would you be interested in hunting it?

I can provide:
• Early demo access
• All assets (images, video, copy)
• Promo codes for your followers
• Anything else you need

No pressure if it's not a fit—I know you're selective!

[Your Name]
[Product Link]
```

**Reality check:** Top hunters get 10-50 requests/week. Don't expect a response. You can successfully launch without a hunter.

---

### Tactic 2: Timing Your Launch

**Best days to launch (2024 data):**
- **Tuesday-Thursday:** Most traffic, most competition
- **Monday:** Lower traffic but less competition
- **Friday:** Avoid (weekend traffic drops)
- **Saturday-Sunday:** Avoid unless consumer/gaming product

**Best months:**
- **January:** New year momentum, high traffic
- **September:** Post-summer return, high traffic
- **Avoid:** Late November-December (holidays), July-August (summer lull)

**Competition research:**
- Check upcoming launches: producthunt.com/upcoming
- Avoid launching same day as major competitor
- Check tech event calendar (avoid launching during TechCrunch Disrupt, etc.)

---

### Tactic 3: Special Offer for PH Community

**Why it works:** PH users expect exclusive deals

**Common offers:**
- Lifetime deal (50-90% off, limited quantity)
- Extended free trial (30-90 days vs standard 14 days)
- Discount code (20-50% off first year)
- Free tier upgrade (premium features for free)
- Early access (beta, new features)

**Examples:**
- **Superhuman:** First month free ($30 value)
- **Notion:** Free credits or upgraded plan
- **AppSumo:** Lifetime deals ($49-$199)

**How to structure:**
- Make it time-limited (24-48 hours)
- Make it valuable (not 10% off, that's weak)
- Make it exclusive ("Only for PH community")
- Make it easy to redeem (promo code in first comment)

**Template:**
"🎉 Special offer for Product Hunt community: Use code PRODUCTHUNT for 50% off your first year (valid for 48 hours)"

---

### Tactic 4: Cross-Promotion with Other Launchers

**Tactic:** Partner with other products launching same day

**How it works:**
1. Find complementary products launching same day
2. Reach out (Twitter DM or email)
3. Agree to upvote + share each other
4. Tag each other in social posts
5. Leave genuine comments on each other's launches

**Benefits:**
- Expands your reach
- Builds community goodwill
- Low effort, high ROI

**Example outreach:**
"Hey! I see we're both launching on PH tomorrow. I'm happy to upvote + share your launch if you'd do the same. Good luck! 🚀"

---

### Tactic 5: Leverage Your Newsletter/Email List

**Pre-launch (1 week before):**
- Announce upcoming PH launch
- Ask subscribers to set reminder
- Build anticipation

**Launch day (12:01am PST):**
- Send email with PH link
- Ask for upvote + comment
- Offer exclusive deal

**Post-launch (End of day):**
- Thank supporters
- Share results
- Deliver on any promises

**Email best practices:**
- Send at 12:01am PST (yes, middle of night for US)
- Use clear subject line: "We're live on Product Hunt!"
- Make ask crystal clear: "Upvote here: [link]"
- Keep it short (3 paragraphs max)
- Mobile-optimized (60% will read on phone)

## Common Product Hunt Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Launching Too Early

**Problem:** Product isn't ready, bugs everywhere, poor experience

**Impact:** Negative reviews, low retention, damaged reputation

**Fix:** Beta test first. Only launch when product is solid (not perfect, but solid).

---

### Mistake 2: No Pre-Built Audience

**Problem:** Launching with zero followers, email list, or community

**Impact:** <50 upvotes, no momentum, poor ranking

**Fix:** Build audience for 3-6 months before launch. Or use hunter with large following.

---

### Mistake 3: Launch and Disappear

**Problem:** Submit product, don't engage in comments

**Impact:** Low engagement score, poor ranking, missed opportunities

**Fix:** Respond to EVERY comment within minutes. Be present all day.

---

### Mistake 4: Spammy Self-Promotion

**Problem:** Join PH day-of-launch, spam upvote requests everywhere

**Impact:** Flagged as spam, downvoted, poor reputation

**Fix:** Build authentic presence 4-8 weeks before launch. Engage genuinely.

---

### Mistake 5: Bad First Impression

**Problem:** Confusing tagline, poor screenshots, broken demo video

**Impact:** Low click-through rate despite high visibility

**Fix:** Test assets with 5-10 people before launch. Optimize for clarity.

---

## Product Hunt Alternatives (2024-2025)

**If PH isn't a fit for your product:**

### Hacker News (Show HN)
- **Audience:** Developers, tech enthusiasts
- **Best for:** Developer tools, open-source, technical products
- **Tactics:** Post Saturday morning, engage in comments, be technical

### IndieHackers
- **Audience:** Solopreneurs, bootstrappers
- **Best for:** Indie SaaS, profitable businesses, bootstrapped tools
- **Tactics:** Share milestones, revenue numbers, honest journey

### Reddit (Relevant Subreddits)
- **Audience:** Varies by subreddit
- **Best for:** Products that genuinely help specific communities
- **Tactics:** Be authentic, lead with value, don't self-promote aggressively

### BetaList
- **Audience:** Early adopters looking for new startups
- **Best for:** Pre-launch waitlist building
- **Tactics:** Submit 2-3 months before launch to build early list

---
