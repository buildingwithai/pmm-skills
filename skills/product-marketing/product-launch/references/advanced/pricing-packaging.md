# Pricing & Packaging for Launch

**Purpose:** Design value-based pricing and packaging strategy that maximizes revenue and aligns with GTM motion.

**When to use:** Days 15-30 of launch planning (positioning complete, before building sales materials).

**Output:** Pricing strategy, packaging tiers, and pricing page optimization.

---

## Overview

Pricing is product positioning expressed in dollars. Get it wrong and you leave money on the table or lose customers entirely.

**Key principle:** Price on value delivered, not cost to build.

**2024 reality:** SaaS pricing has shifted from per-seat to usage-based and value-based models. Customers expect flexibility.

---

## Pricing Foundations

### The Three Pricing Models

**1. Cost-Plus Pricing** ❌ (Avoid)

**Formula:** Cost to deliver + desired margin = price

**Example:** Costs $20/user to serve → charge $40/user (100% margin)

**Why it fails:**
- Ignores customer value perception
- Leaves money on the table (if value >> cost)
- Doesn't account for willingness to pay
- Race to the bottom on price

---

**2. Competitive Pricing** ⚠️ (Use with caution)

**Formula:** Match or undercut competitor pricing

**Example:** Competitor charges $99/mo → you charge $79/mo

**When to use:**
- Launching in crowded market with commoditized products
- Need to gain initial market share quickly
- Differentiating on other factors (support, features, UX)

**Why it's risky:**
- Assumes competitors priced correctly (they often didn't)
- Hard to raise prices later
- Positions you as "cheaper," not "better"

**When it works:**
- Clear market leader exists (e.g., Salesforce at $150/user, you're at $120/user)
- You can defend lower price with lower cost structure
- Temporary tactic to gain traction, not long-term strategy

---

**3. Value-Based Pricing** ✅ (Recommended)

**Formula:** Price = % of value delivered to customer

**Example:** Product saves customer $10K/month → charge $2K/month (20% of value)

**Why it works:**
- Aligns price with customer outcomes
- Justifies premium pricing
- Creates room for expansion as value grows
- Supports strong margins

**How to calculate value:**
1. Identify customer outcome (revenue gain, cost savings, time savings)
2. Quantify impact ($X revenue, Y hours saved)
3. Convert to dollar value (Y hours × hourly rate = $Z)
4. Price at 10-30% of value delivered

**Example (time savings):**
- Product saves marketing team 20 hours/week
- Marketing manager hourly rate: $75/hour
- Value: 20 hours × $75 × 4 weeks = $6,000/month saved
- Price: $1,200/month (20% of value)

**Example (revenue gain):**
- Product increases sales conversion by 2%
- Customer does $500K/month revenue
- Value: $500K × 2% = $10K/month additional revenue
- Price: $2,000/month (20% of value)

---

## Packaging Strategy

### The 3-Tier Model (Most Common)

**Why 3 tiers:**
- **Psychology:** Middle tier becomes default (anchoring effect)
- **Segmentation:** Serves different customer sizes (SMB, mid-market, enterprise)
- **Expansion:** Natural upgrade path as customers grow

**Tier structure:**

| Tier | Target Audience | Price Point | Features |
|------|----------------|-------------|----------|
| **Starter** | Individuals, small teams (1-5 users) | $X (lowest) | Core features, basic support |
| **Professional** | Growing teams (6-50 users) | $3-5X | All features, priority support |
| **Enterprise** | Large orgs (50+ users) | $10-20X | Custom + dedicated support |

---

### Tier Naming Best Practices

**Avoid generic names:**
- ❌ Basic, Standard, Premium (boring, conveys no value)
- ❌ Bronze, Silver, Gold (feels cheap)
- ❌ Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3 (lazy)

**Use value-driven or persona-driven names:**
- ✅ **Persona-driven:** Freelancer, Team, Enterprise (Figma)
- ✅ **Value-driven:** Starter, Growth, Scale (clear progression)
- ✅ **Brand-aligned:** Free, Pro, Business (simple, clean)

**Examples from top SaaS companies (2024):**
- **Notion:** Free, Plus, Business, Enterprise
- **Slack:** Free, Pro, Business+, Enterprise Grid
- **Superhuman:** Individual, Team (only 2 tiers)
- **Linear:** Free, Standard, Plus, Enterprise

---

### Feature Gating Strategy

**Core principle:** Gate features by value, not by arbitrary limits

**Good feature gating (value-aligned):**
- ✅ Starter: 1 workspace, Professional: Unlimited workspaces
- ✅ Starter: Email support, Professional: Priority chat support
- ✅ Starter: Basic analytics, Professional: Advanced analytics + custom reports
- ✅ Starter: 1GB storage, Professional: 100GB storage

**Bad feature gating (frustrating):**
- ❌ Starter: 3 projects (arbitrary limit that frustrates users)
- ❌ Starter: Can't export data (holding data hostage)
- ❌ Starter: No integrations (core value locked behind paywall)
- ❌ Starter: Ads or branding (feels extractive)

**The "good/better/best" framework:**

**Starter (Good):**
- Core product functionality works
- Perfect for testing and small use cases
- Limited by scale, not capability

**Professional (Better):**
- Unlocks collaboration and team features
- Advanced functionality for power users
- Scales with business growth

**Enterprise (Best):**
- Everything + dedicated support
- Custom features, integrations, security
- White-glove service

---

## Pricing Metrics (How You Charge)

### Common SaaS Pricing Metrics

**1. Per-Seat (User-Based)**

**Example:** $10/user/month

**Best for:**
- Collaboration tools (Slack, Figma, Notion)
- Team productivity software
- Internal tools (everyone on team uses it)

**Pros:**
- Simple to understand
- Predictable revenue growth (scales with headcount)
- Natural expansion as team grows

**Cons:**
- Discourages broad adoption (users avoid inviting teammates to save money)
- Unfair if only few users drive value
- "Seat sharing" workaround (multiple people share one login)

**2024 trend:** Moving away from pure per-seat to hybrid models

---

**2. Usage-Based (Consumption)**

**Example:** $0.50 per API call, $5 per GB processed

**Best for:**
- APIs and developer tools (Stripe, Twilio, AWS)
- Data processing (Snowflake, Databricks)
- High-variance usage patterns

**Pros:**
- Aligns cost with value (pay for what you use)
- Lower barrier to entry (start small)
- Unlimited expansion potential

**Cons:**
- Revenue unpredictable (usage varies month to month)
- Requires usage tracking infrastructure
- Can surprise users with big bills (bill shock)

**2024 trend:** Growing rapidly (35% of new SaaS uses usage-based, per OpenView)

---

**3. Flat-Rate (All-Inclusive)**

**Example:** $99/month for unlimited everything

**Best for:**
- Simple products with predictable costs
- Want to remove friction from buying decision
- Target small teams or individuals

**Pros:**
- Dead simple (no math, no surprises)
- Easy to budget for customers
- Reduces customer success overhead

**Cons:**
- Leaves money on table (power users underpriced)
- Doesn't scale with customer growth
- "Unlimited" can be abused

**Example:** Superhuman ($30/user, all features included)

---

**4. Tiered (Feature-Based)**

**Example:** Starter $49, Pro $99, Enterprise $299

**Best for:**
- Products with clear feature differentiation
- Serving multiple customer segments
- Want to capture SMB and enterprise

**Pros:**
- Serves different willingness to pay
- Clear upgrade path
- Can optimize pricing per tier

**Cons:**
- Complex to communicate (which tier for me?)
- Requires active management of tiers
- Customers game the system (stay on lower tier)

---

**5. Hybrid (Combination)**

**Example:** $50/month base + $5/user + $0.10/transaction

**Best for:**
- Complex products with multiple value drivers
- Mature companies optimizing revenue
- High variance in customer usage

**Pros:**
- Captures value from multiple dimensions
- Aligns closely with value delivered
- Expansion from multiple levers

**Cons:**
- Complex to understand and communicate
- Hard to predict bills (friction in buying)
- Requires sophisticated pricing infrastructure

**Example:** Intercom (base price + per seat + per conversation)

---

## Pricing Psychology

### The Decoy Effect (Anchoring)

**Tactic:** Make middle tier look like best value by adding expensive top tier

**Example:**
- Starter: $29/mo (seems cheap but limited)
- **Professional: $79/mo** ⭐ MOST POPULAR (best value)
- Enterprise: $299/mo (expensive, makes Pro look reasonable)

**Result:** 60-70% of customers choose middle tier

**How to design decoy:**
1. Price top tier 3-5x middle tier
2. Add "Most Popular" badge to middle tier
3. Highlight value gap (Pro has 80% of Enterprise features at 25% of cost)

---

### The Power of 9 (Charm Pricing)

**Research:** Prices ending in 9 or 99 convert better than round numbers

**Examples:**
- $99/mo converts better than $100/mo
- $49.99 converts better than $50
- Effect strongest in B2C, weaker in B2B enterprise

**When to use:**
- Self-serve pricing (PLG motion)
- SMB customers (price-sensitive)
- Consumer products

**When to avoid:**
- Enterprise pricing (looks cheap)
- Premium positioning (round numbers signal quality)
- Very high price points ($10,000/mo, not $9,999/mo)

---

### Annual vs Monthly Pricing

**Standard discount:** 15-20% off for annual (2 months free)

**Example:**
- Monthly: $99/mo ($1,188/year)
- Annual: $999/year (16% discount, same as $83.25/mo)

**Why offer annual:**
- ✅ Improved cash flow (collect 12 months upfront)
- ✅ Lower churn (harder to cancel annual)
- ✅ Better unit economics (12 months LTV upfront)
- ✅ Reduces involuntary churn (expired credit cards)

**Tactics to drive annual:**
- Offer 2-3 months free (vs 15-20% "discount")
- "Most Popular" badge on annual plan
- Enterprise tier = annual only
- Limit features on monthly (e.g., no annual reports)

**2024 data:** 40-60% of B2B SaaS customers choose annual when offered proper incentive

---

### Freemium vs Free Trial

**Freemium:**
- **Model:** Free tier forever, limited features
- **Goal:** High volume acquisition, upsell later
- **Conversion:** 2-5% free → paid (typical)
- **Best for:** PLG, viral products, low CAC needed
- **Examples:** Notion, Slack, Figma

**Free Trial:**
- **Model:** Full features for 14-30 days, then pay or lose access
- **Goal:** Qualified leads, faster conversion
- **Conversion:** 15-25% trial → paid (typical)
- **Best for:** Higher ACV products, sales-assisted
- **Examples:** Superhuman, HubSpot, Salesforce

**Reverse Trial (emerging 2024 trend):**
- **Model:** Start with paid, offer money-back guarantee
- **Benefit:** No "free tier pollution," committed users only
- **Example:** "Try free for 30 days, full refund if not satisfied"

---

## Pricing Page Optimization

### Essential Elements

**1. Clear Value Proposition (above fold):**
- "Plans that scale with your business"
- "Simple, transparent pricing"
- "Try free for 14 days, no credit card required"

**2. Toggle (Monthly vs Annual):**
- Show both options, default to annual
- Highlight savings: "Save 20% with annual"

**3. 3 Tiers (visual comparison):**
- Feature grid (rows = features, columns = tiers)
- Checkmarks for included features
- "Most Popular" badge on middle tier
- CTA buttons ("Start Free Trial" or "Get Started")

**4. FAQ Section (below fold):**
- "Can I change plans later?" (Yes, anytime)
- "What payment methods do you accept?" (CC, ACH, invoice for enterprise)
- "Is there a contract?" (Monthly is no contract, annual is 12 months)
- "Can I cancel anytime?" (Yes, with prorated refunds)

**5. Social Proof:**
- "Trusted by 10,000+ teams"
- Customer logos
- G2/Capterra ratings

**6. Risk Reversal:**
- Money-back guarantee (14-30 days)
- No credit card required for trial
- Cancel anytime

## Launch Pricing Strategy

### Pricing for PLG Launch

**Recommended structure:**
- **Free tier:** Core features, 1-2 user limit, builds awareness
- **Starter tier:** $29-49/mo, designed for individuals/small teams
- **Professional tier:** $99-149/mo, designed for teams (mark "Most Popular")
- **Enterprise tier:** $299+/mo or custom, sales-led

**Launch tactics:**
- Offer lifetime deal (limited time, creates urgency)
- Extended free trial (30-60 days vs standard 14 days)
- Launch discount (30-50% off first year)
- Product Hunt exclusive offer

**Example launch offer:**
"🚀 Launch Special: 50% off first year for first 100 customers (code: LAUNCH50)"

---

### Pricing for Sales-Led Launch

**Recommended structure:**
- **Published pricing:** Starter/Professional tier (self-serve)
- **Enterprise tier:** "Contact Sales" (custom pricing)
- **Discounting strategy:** 10-20% for annual, 20-30% for multi-year

**Launch tactics:**
- Pilot pricing (50% off first year for design partners)
- Proof-of-concept (POC) free for 30-60 days
- Quarterly business reviews (QBR) = relationship building
- Executive sponsorship (CTO, VP talks to customer CTO)

---

### Pricing Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake 1: Pricing Too Low**

**Symptom:** Fast adoption, low revenue, can't afford support/sales

**Impact:** Attracts wrong customers, can't sustain growth, hard to raise prices later

**Fix:** Charge for value. If customers don't complain about price, you're too cheap.

---

**Mistake 2: Too Many Tiers**

**Symptom:** 5-7 pricing tiers, customers confused

**Impact:** Decision paralysis, lower conversion, support overhead

**Fix:** Max 3-4 tiers. If you need more, you're serving too many segments.

---

**Mistake 3: Arbitrary Feature Gating**

**Symptom:** Core features locked behind highest tier for no reason

**Impact:** Frustrates users, feels extractive, poor activation

**Fix:** Gate features by value, not arbitrarily. Free tier should deliver core value.

---

**Mistake 4: No Pricing Experimentation**

**Symptom:** Set pricing at launch, never changed

**Impact:** Leaving money on table or losing customers to price

**Fix:** A/B test pricing every 6-12 months. Iterate based on data.

---

## Pricing Experimentation

### When to Test Pricing

**Test when:**
- ✅ Launching new product (test before public launch)
- ✅ Quarterly/annually (regular optimization)
- ✅ Expanding to new segment (SMB → Enterprise)
- ✅ Adding major features (justify price increase)
- ✅ Competitive pressure (need to adjust)

**Don't test when:**
- ❌ First 100 customers (too noisy, need baseline)
- ❌ During major campaign (too many variables)
- ❌ Less than 1,000 visitors/month (not statistically significant)

---

### What to Test

**High-impact tests:**
1. **Price points:** $99/mo vs $149/mo (33% increase)
2. **Annual discount:** 15% off vs 20% off vs 25% off
3. **Feature gating:** Which features in which tier
4. **Packaging:** 3 tiers vs 4 tiers vs 2 tiers
5. **Pricing metric:** Per-seat vs usage-based vs flat-rate

**Medium-impact tests:**
6. **CTA copy:** "Start Free Trial" vs "Get Started" vs "Try for Free"
7. **Free tier limits:** 1 user vs 3 users vs 5 users
8. **Trial length:** 14 days vs 30 days vs 60 days

---

### How to Run Pricing Tests

**Method 1: A/B Test (New Customers Only)**

**Setup:**
- 50% see pricing A, 50% see pricing B
- Run for 2-4 weeks or until statistical significance
- Measure: conversion rate, revenue per customer, LTV

**Example:**
- Control: $99/mo
- Variant: $149/mo (+50%)
- Result: Conversion drops 15%, but revenue per customer up 30% = net win

**Tools:**
- Optimizely, VWO (visual A/B testing)
- Statsig, LaunchDarkly (feature flags + pricing experiments)
- Google Optimize (free, basic)

---

**Method 2: Grandfather Existing Customers**

**Tactic:** Raise prices for new customers, keep existing customers at old price

**Why it works:**
- No churn from price increase
- Reward loyalty
- Test new pricing on new cohort

**Communication:**
"We're raising prices to $149/mo for new customers starting March 1. As a thank-you for your support, you'll stay at $99/mo as long as you remain a customer."

---

**Method 3: Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter**

**Tactic:** Survey to understand willingness to pay

**Questions:**
1. At what price would this product be so expensive you'd never consider it?
2. At what price would this product be expensive but still worth considering?
3. At what price would this product be a bargain?
4. At what price would this product be so cheap you'd question its quality?

**Analysis:** Plot responses to find optimal price range

**Sample size:** 100-300 responses minimum

---

## Pricing Communication

### Announcing Price Increases

**When to raise prices:**
- After adding significant features
- When costs increase substantially
- Annually (2-5% inflation adjustment)
- To align with market (if underpriced)

## Next Steps

**Before launch:**
1. Complete positioning work (see `positioning` skill)
2. Research customer value delivered (interviews, surveys)
3. Calculate value-based price (10-30% of value delivered)
4. Design 3-tier packaging
5. Build pricing page (see examples above)
6. A/B test pricing with beta users

**During launch:**
1. Monitor conversion rate (visitor → sign-up → paid)
2. Track revenue per customer
3. Survey users on pricing perceptions
4. Interview users who churned due to price

**Post-launch:**
1. Analyze pricing impact on metrics
2. A/B test price points (quarterly)
3. Iterate packaging based on usage data
4. Plan annual pricing review
